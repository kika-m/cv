  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p> I was born in january 2º of 2004, since i was young one of my favourite things to do was identifying patterns, all around me,
    i would identify them in everything, it could be in nature, people, sounds etc... so my father thought it would be a good idea
    if i learned how to code as it envolves a lot of patterns, as per usual he was right and now i really enjoy coding.
    My mother inspired me to become an enthusiastic reader, reading has helped me in a lot of ways and i am forever grateful
    to her.
    My goals right now are to learn new coding languages, read more books and finish my education.
    In the future i would like to pursue a career in physics,one of my passions, or something related to computation.
